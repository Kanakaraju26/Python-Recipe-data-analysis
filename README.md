# 🍽️ Recipe Data Analysis using Python (Kaggle Dataset)

Welcome to my data analysis project! In this repository, I have performed **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on a recipe dataset using **Python** in **Jupyter Notebook**. This project was inspired by a dataset from **Kaggle**, and it focuses on analyzing ingredients from various cuisines.

## 📁 Project File

- `Recipe Kaggle EDA web example.ipynb`: The main notebook containing all the data analysis steps, visualizations, and insights.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- JSON

## 📊 What I Did

- Loaded and parsed JSON dataset containing recipes and their ingredients.
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to:
  - Identify the most common ingredients.
  - Compare cuisines based on ingredient frequency.
  - Visualize patterns and distributions using bar plots and histograms.
- Explored relationships between ingredients and cuisine types.

## 📌 Insights Gained

- Some ingredients are common across many cuisines (like salt, garlic, and onion).
- Others are highly specific to certain cuisines, giving insight into their uniqueness.
- Ingredient distribution varies significantly between cuisines, and visualizations helped uncover these trends.

## 🔍 Dataset Source

- The dataset is originally from [Kaggle - What's Cooking?](https://www.kaggle.com/c/whats-cooking/data), a popular competition for recipe classification based on ingredients.
